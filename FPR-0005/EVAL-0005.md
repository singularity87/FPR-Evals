It has failed point 3.  

- Formatting needs to be fixed in the 'Budget' section for readability.  
- To do a line return two spaces need to be put at the end of a line. Alternatively a list can be used.

It has failed point 9.  

- We would recommend some changes to improve the cost vs impact ratio. 
- Remove the competition for $1200 and rather spend some of this money on creation of high quality print media and content that can be reused at other conferences. I.e. flyers, banners, posters and powerpoint slides.
- Remove the RSVP $10 to the first 20 businesses and instead replace it with giving every person who attends $5 in BCH as a paper wallet.
- (If it is allowed) sell drinks and refreshments cheaply and allow people to pay with BCH.
